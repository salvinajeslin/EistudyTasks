# CustomerSupportChain

##  Project Overview
**CustomerSupportChain** is a Java-based implementation of the **Chain of Responsibility design pattern**.  
The system simulates a customer support process where requests (complaints/issues) are passed through different support levels until resolved.

The chain contains three levels of support:
- **LevelOneSupport**
- **LevelTwoSupport**
- **LevelThreeSupport**

Each level checks if it can handle the request based on its severity level and either resolves it or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

---

##  Features
- Implements **Chain of Responsibility pattern** for handling support requests.
- Handles multiple levels of support dynamically.
- Centralized logging mechanism.
- User-friendly input handling with validation.
- Robust exception handling to ensure program stability.
- Modular and maintainable code structure.

---

##  How It Works
1. The application starts and initializes the chain of responsibility.
2. Users input a **support level** and a **message**.
3. Requests are passed through the chain:
    - If the current handler can process the request, it resolves it.
    - If not, it passes it to the next handler in the chain.
4. Process repeats until the request is handled or the chain ends.
