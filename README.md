# EiStudy Tasks - Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** in Java, organized into two exercises:

- **EiStudyEx1** → Individual design pattern projects.
- **EiStudyEx2** → A single integrated project (`SmartOfficeFacility`) demonstrating multiple patterns together.

---

##  EiStudyEx1 - Design Patterns

This section showcases different **Creational, Structural, and Behavioural Design Patterns** with real-world examples.

### 1. Behavioural Design Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** → *Customer Support System*
- **Observer Pattern** → *Fitness Tracker Notification System*

### 2. Creational Design Patterns
- **Abstract Factory Pattern** → *Theme Factory System*
- **Builder Pattern** → *Student Registration System*

### 3. Structural Design Patterns
- **Decorator Pattern** → *StarBuzz Coffee Shop*
- **Proxy Pattern** → *Smart Image Proxy System*

##  EiStudyEx2 - Smart Office Facility

This section contains a full-fledged project demonstrating multiple patterns together:

- **Command Pattern** → For booking, cancelling, and managing room occupancy.
- **Observer Pattern** → For monitoring AC and Light systems.
- **Singleton Pattern** → For centralized office management (`OfficeManager`).
- **Custom Logger** → For logging activities.

Project: **SmartOfficeFacility**

---

##  How to Run

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or Eclipse.
2. Navigate to the desired subproject under `EiStudyEx1` or open `SmartOfficeFacility` under `EiStudyEx2`.
3. Go to the `src/` folder and run `App.java` (or `Main.java`).
4. Observe the console output for pattern demonstrations.

---

##  Requirements
- Java 8 or above
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

---

##  Notes
- Each subproject may also contain its own `README.md` with detailed explanation and examples.
- `EiStudyEx1` is for **individual patterns**.
- `EiStudyEx2` is for **combined usage of multiple patterns in one project**.
